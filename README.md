# Random Number Generator 


## Intro
Cyber security is one of the most important factors in technology. Information is being passed along from user to servers with important information. One of the best ways to protect users from potential threats (i.e hackers/bug) is to have a strong password.

## My Generater
My generator creates a randomized password that is betwen 8 to 128 characters long. The password can inclue upper, lower, numeric, and special characters. This allows the computer to generate a strong password, especially if passwords are in the 100s. The password generated will be strong and will be able to compied from the board.

## Trouble
THere were many different varation of this generator. The first instance was a button clicked system rather than prompt. I found this to be difficult because I still did not have a full grasp on adding elements from java to html. THe other instance was adding trying to use the charCode() to obtain unicode characters. This failed because i failed to grap using charCode() in a math.floor(math.random).

## Conclusion 
This generator was defintely a challenege to create. It utlized past concepts of for loops, random function, arrays, booleans, and if else statements to really test my knowlege. The next time I create a generator, I would probably add buttons instead of using prompts and using the charCode method to obtain random characters. This would create a better user experience and make the generator less clunky.
